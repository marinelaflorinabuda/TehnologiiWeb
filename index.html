                <h3>Why Adopt a Dog or Cat Over Buying?</h2>
                <p class="lead">Did you know that over 1,000 people per hour run a search right here looking to adopt a pet? Pet adoption is quickly becoming the 
                    preferred way to find a new dog, puppy, cat or kitten. Best of all, there are so many benefits when you adopt a dog or adopt a cat over buying. 
                    For instance, pet adoption will almost always be more affordable than buying a puppy for sale from a breeder or finding a kitten for sale from a 
                    litter. </p>
                <p class="lead"> Since pets in rescues and shelters usually come from a home where the owners ran out of money, got divorced,
                     or had to move, it's common to find that the dogs and cats on our website are already housetrained, good with kids, or do well with other pets. 
                    That means less stress, and more savings! So what are you waiting for? 
                     Go find that perfect pet!</p>

                <h3>The Experts</h4>
                    <p>Have you addressed what type of pet personality you are looking for? Wait a second, 
                        did we just say personality, and not breed? Yes, that is right. Finding the ideal pet 
                        for yourself or family should start with an understanding of the ideal pet personality.
                         Do you need a dog that is low key and good with kids, or are you looking 
                         for an energetic pal who is into trail running? </p>

                    <h3>The Tools You Need to Find the Perfect Pet</h4>
                        <p>Our website has a feature called "New Pet Alert."

                             pet is available! So even if you've made the commitment to adopt a puppy or adopt 
                             a kitten, we will email you immediately when we know of a local little furry fellow 
                             who is in need of a new home!</p>

                    <h2>Why the relationship between owners and pets is always an unconditional one ?</h2>
                    <p>Pets give people so much in terms of love and emotional support. Simply stroking a dog, cat, rabbit or even horse can lead to lower blood pressure and can combat stress. 
                        The feelings are reciprocated, as our touch can have therapeutic effects for our pets, particularly if they are feeling out of sorts.

                    </p>
                    <p > Companion animals can provide support and friendship to societyâ€™s lonely, sick or elderly. They can be friends to 
                        those who do not easily understand the world around them. Autistic children for instance can be guided gently from their closed, 
                        confusing and isolated worlds by a patient and loving dog or cat. Anxiety disorders and depression also can be eased by the loving presence of a pet.</p>
